# UbiComp In Class Assignment One
In this repository find code for reading from the serial port 
and plotting to screen using python and arduino.

The python examples are shown using jupyter notebook, where possible. 
Please note these are learning exercises and the code and methods used here are updated throughout the semester. Code here is chosen for simplicity, not efficiency. 

To run the examples you will need the following packages:
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- numpy
- pyserial

All of which can be installed using anaconda (the method I selected).

Additionally, I used the energia IDE (modeled after Arduino) with a RedBear WiFi mini. However, there is no need to use a special uController. The uController is simply used to write bytes to the serial port. Even so, I would recommend getting accustomed to using the WiFi enabled uController because we will use it more extensively as the class progresses.
